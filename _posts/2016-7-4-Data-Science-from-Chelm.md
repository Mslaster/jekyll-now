title: Data Science from Chelm
---

There's an old folktale where an unfortune citizen of Chelm (think the European-Jewish equivalent to the Simpson's Springfield) is searching for his lost watch one night. He seems to be spending an inordinate amount of time looking around a streetlamp. An onlooker notices this and asks him, "did you lose your watch by the streetlamp?" He replies, "no, I'm just looking under the lamp because here there's light."

In working on Project Benson, where our group was charged with finding an optimal strategy for canvassing NYC subway station for participants at a gala, I had the nagging feeling that we were behaving like this poor Chelmite. Don't get me wrong- I think we approached the problem quite rationally from the start. We broke the problem into two distinct goals: 1) To find hotspots to target potential donors and 2) To get potential student ambassadors sympathetic to our cause. We integrated our primary source of data, MTA subway swipe records, together with income demographics and college enrollment to identify optimal target stations. But, I still had my suspicions.

I felt that, in trying to develop an optimal strategy, there were so many questions that were still unanswered. How exactly do we combine our data? Is it best to use our manpower to flood one station in a high-income area or spread out to many? Is it better to target lower-traffic stations outside of colleges campuses or hope to find a bunch of undergrads in the massive crowds at Grand Central? We were being content simply working with the simple strategies that were available...just like the foolish Chelmite was looking for his watch under the streetlight? 

After seeing the varied appraoches of the cohort's other teams, one underlying point started to really hit me. Even when using data-driven approaches, the success of a strategy still rests on many assumptions. Some groups made assumptions about when people would be most open to cooperating with canvassers. Others made assumptions of reasonable Metrocard swipe rates (to scrub out bad data). The need to make plausible assumptions along the way seems inherent to the process. So...does that mean we are all just looking poking around the dark streets of Chelm looking for our watches? Not quite. Building good data-driven models is an iterative process. We work with what we have until we can find better. We are looking under the streetlamp...while building some high-powered flashlights!
